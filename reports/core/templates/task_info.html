        <h3>Basic information</h3>
        <p> This app were created as a test task. The main requirements were as follows</p>
          <li>Anonymous user can only access <a href="{% url 'greetings' %}">README</a> page  and login or registration forms</li>
        <li>To create an entry user provide such data</li>
          <ul><li>date</li>
              <li>distance </li>
              <li>duration</li></ul>
        <li>When user see list of entries, application also shows average speed</li>
        <li>User should be able to filter list of entries by date range</li>
        <li>There should be a page with per week statistics for last year - week number, total amount of entries, total distance, total duration and average speed</li>
        <li>Minimal front-end design required</li>
          <hr>
          <p>
              Sorting by speed, duration and distance was added, but still not operate well.
              Will be fixed later :)
